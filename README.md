# String Generator
stringGenerator.js is a simple function for password or alphanumeric string generation. It can be included as a helper function for any site that needs to generate strings.

This function is designed to work in a page with tick boxes whose value can be read and placed in the function call, but it can also be used with presets if only one type of string will be needed.
